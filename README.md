# Python Sudoku Solver  

A Python-based Sudoku solver developed for the **Artificial Intelligence course** at **Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)**. This project demonstrates the application of AI techniques such as **backtracking**, **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)**, and **forward checking** to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles.  

## Features  
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Implements a systematic way to explore possible solutions.  
- **MRV Heuristic**: Prioritizes cells with the fewest legal values to improve efficiency.  
- **Forward Checking**: Propagates constraints to reduce the search space.  
- **Customizable Input**: Supports user-provided Sudoku puzzles.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  

## Purpose  
This project explores constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and demonstrates AI techniques for solving combinatorial problems in an efficient and structured manner.
